    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Classic lasagna is built by layering tender lasagna noodles with a rich, savory meat sauce and creamy cheese
        filling: sautéed onions and garlic are browned with ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork), then simmered with
        crushed tomatoes, a splash of red wine, and Italian herbs until thick and fragrant; meanwhile, combine ricotta
        (or béchamel), an egg, and grated Parmesan, and shred plenty of mozzarella. Spread a thin layer of sauce in a
        baking dish, add noodles, dollops of the ricotta mixture, more sauce, and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella
        and Parmesan, then repeat layers until the dish is full. Bake at about 375°F (190°C) for 35–45 minutes until the
        top is golden and bubbling, let it rest 10–15 minutes to set, then slice and serve for a hearty, comforting
        meal.</p>
