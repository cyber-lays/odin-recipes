    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beer cheese soup is a rich and creamy soup that combines the flavors of sharp cheddar cheese and beer for a comforting and indulgent dish. The soup starts with a base of sautéed onions and garlic, which are then simmered in a mixture of beer and chicken broth. Sharp cheddar cheese is melted into the soup, creating a velvety texture and a bold flavor. The soup is often finished with a touch of cream for added richness. Beer cheese soup is perfect for chilly days and is often served with crusty bread or soft pretzels for dipping.</p>
