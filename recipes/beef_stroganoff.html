    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beef Stroganoff is a classic Russian dish that features tender strips of beef cooked in a creamy mushroom sauce, typically served over egg noodles or rice. The dish is known for its rich flavors and comforting texture. To prepare Beef Stroganoff, start by sautéing onions and mushrooms in a skillet until they are soft and fragrant. Then, add thinly sliced beef (such as sirloin or tenderloin) and cook until browned. Next, create the sauce by adding beef broth, sour cream, and a touch of Dijon mustard to the skillet, allowing it to simmer until thickened. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika for added depth of flavor. Finally, serve the beef stroganoff over cooked egg noodles or rice, garnished with fresh parsley for a delicious and satisfying meal.</p>
